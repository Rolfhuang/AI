    "The rules of Wraparound Impact Isolation are a variation of the original Isolation game. In the original form of the game there are two players, each with their own game piece, and a 7-by-7 grid of squares. At the beginning of the game, the first player places their piece on any square. The second player follows suit, and places their piece on any one of the available squares. From that point on, the players alternate turns moving their piece like a queen in chess (any number of open squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). When the piece is moved, the square that was previously occupied is blocked, and cannot be used for the remainder of the game. The first player who is unable to move their queen loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this variant called Wraparound Impact Isolation, each player's piece creates an impact crater around itself when it moves **more than one block** in any direction. This impact crater blocks 4 locations (North, South, East, West) around the location the queen moves to, effectively reducing the queen's mobility to that of a bishop the next turn. Also, pieces can wraparound to the other side of the board, similar to Pac-Man. We start with a 9-by-9 grid in this variation. Neither players can move on or through squares blocked by this impact. For clarity, examine the scenario below:\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/wraparound_impact_1.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1 moves horizontally to the right for 4 blocks and creates an impact around it, consequently blocking some of Q2's potential future moves. The previous location of Q1 is also blocked along with the \"_impact_\"ed locations\n",

    "<img src=\"./img/wraparound_impact_2.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",

While you can use Iterative Deepening & Alpha-Beta (ID+AB) to beat our agents in all of the sections, going directly for ID+AB is error prone. As such, we highly recommend you to start with MiniMax (MM), then implement Alpha-Beta (AB), and only then go for ID+AB.\n",
    "- By default, right now `move()` calls `minimax()` as you can see below.\n",
    "- You are not allowed to modify the function signatures or class signatures we provide. However, in case you want to have an additonal parameter you can do it at the very end of parameter list (see examples below). However, it must have a default value and you shouldn't expect it to be passed on the server-side (i.e. Gradescope). Thus, Gradescope will be using the default value.\n",

    "- You're right, and that's on purpose. Each of the bullets below try to walk you through how you may want to think about beating the remaining agents.\n",
    "    - First up is the alphabeta agent. Vanilla alphabeta (that is, alphabeta with no optimization) may not do so well against this agent. However, any agent that searches deeper with the same algorithm probably has a bigger advantage. You may learn about a method that allows your algorithm to search in such a way that you can find the maximum search depth without running out of time. This will probably come up in class or you can read through the book to find out what you are looking for.\n",
    "    - Next to beat is the agent with iterative deepening. This one is a little harder to think about, given that you may have used all the tools that you may think of to try a make a \"better\" agent. But you may have just implemented the evaluation function that was discussed in class. Maybe we can do better - like checking for winning moves and prioritizing those! Or if you are feeling really creative, you can always try editing the `CustomEvalFn` below this cell and come up with an awesome idea of your own.\n",
    "    - Now to Peter's agent with the secret evaluation function (Extra Credit). Here we have nothing to tell you. Use everything in your toolbox and within the class rules to defeat it. This is by far the hardest 5 points to get! Good luck and have fun!\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Remember that you may want to edit the methods in the cell with the `CustomPlayer` class to try and implement some of the above. You are certainly free to as long as you adhere to the general rules about editing provided code (which can be found by reading the cell above the `CustomPlayer` code)."
